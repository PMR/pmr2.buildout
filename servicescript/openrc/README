These OpenRC init scripts may be copied into ``/etc/init.d``.

Update all $PMR_* values in each of the scripts, then do the following:

    # rc-update add pmr2.zeoserver default
    # rc-update add pmr2.instance default

You could test by doing

    # /etc/init.d/pmr2.zeoserver start
    # /etc/init.d/pmr2.instance start

Then connect to your site.  For intended result, restart your server
and ensure that both services come back online.

Of course, if you renamed other paths/files please update your copy of
the scripts accordingly.
